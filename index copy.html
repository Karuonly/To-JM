                <p> 
                    <span>
                        &emsp; First off, let me offer my apologies for not responding, not talking, and not being there. I acknowledge that I have been distant and I can imagine how that might have felt from your point of view. Leaving things silent and without offer an explanation wasn't fair.
                    </span>
                    <br> <br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp;  My mental health has not been too great after the things i heard and gone through recently. I've been keeping everything to myself, enduring it all, and smiling my way through — even when it got difficult. It was easier not saying anything.
                    </span>
                    <br> <br>  
                    <span>
                        &emsp; That said, hindi lang ako basta basta nag block at nawalan ng interest sa mga project at mga messages. Marami kayong ginawa na nakakasakit makita o marinig, nong nalaman kong may gc kayong apat wala naman akong paki, pero sa mga sumusunod na araw wala ng kumakausap o nakikipaglaro sa akin. Kaya nag leave nalang ako sa beehive, nasasaktan na kasi ako dahil wala naman akong ginawang masama? Alam ko naman na hindi mo sinasadya na palagi sumama palagi sa kanila sa mga call at laro, sila naman kasi palagi mo kausap. 
                        <span>
                            <br><br>
                            <span>  
                                &emsp; Hindi naman na sa nagtatampo ako or nagseselos ako na minsan minsan kayong apat lang ang nag-uusap or naglalaro. Wala lang kasi akong kausap o kaibigan na sobrang close ko, my social is always dry or no new notif from someone, ako palagi mag-isa. Pero sanay ako laging mag-isa, nasaktan lang talaga ako dahil 7 months ako nag indure na ako lang mag-isa, alam ko namang na re reach out ka sakin pero tinitignan kolang kasi hindi nawawala sa isip ko yong mga moments na parang hindi ninyo ako kilala or palang wala lang ako don naririnig susunod ninyong plano magtrotropa. That's why i distance myself para hindi na ako masaktan. 
                                <span>
                                    <br> <br>   
                                </span>
                                &emsp; So, yes. I apologize for the not reaching out, im for sorry for not spending time with you more in your last year sa SRSPC, im sorry i blocked and ghosted you, im sorry for being a bad friend, im sorry for everything i've done to you…  Even though hindi kita kinakausap you still contact me and send me videos in tiktok, which i well appreciate for the rest of my life. 
                                <span>

                                </span>
                                &emsp; You asked the question about whether we “could be friends again?” and to be fair we are still friends i just distant myself to focus more on my self and fix my mental health which is deteriorating sa mga pinagdaanan ko. And from this moment on if you wish to ask a question or message me and I will reply. You were the hope i had when i was at my lowest, no one to talk to and no one to play with. But you were the only one reaching out to me and playing with me, So i thank for that.
                            </span>
                            <br> <br>
                        </span>
                        &emsp; I’m not writing this to start a fight or to blame anyone of you - i just needed to express my emotions, before its to late for me to express anything to you.
                        <span>
                            <br><br>
                            <span>
                            &emsp; Every moment that i had spending my time with you IRL or online is going to be “The Treasure of my life”. I hope you become an excellent student in city college and be recognize by others their and make new friends.
                        </span>
                        <br> <br>
                    </span>
                    &emsp; Be yourself and be yourself always and dont be a peoples pleasure and always focus on yourself first.
                    <span>
                        <br> <br>  
                    </span>
                    &emsp; Once again, thank you for everything. You will always stay in my memories and i will not forget the time you spent with us at SRSPC. 
                </p>
